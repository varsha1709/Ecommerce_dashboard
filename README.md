## Problem Statement

In todayâ€™s highly competitive online retail environment, understanding customer behavior and business performance is crucial for sustainable growth. However, many e-commerce companies struggle to gain real-time, actionable insights from their vast data repositories. This dashboard project aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive, interactive platform that helps e-commerce businesses track their key performance indicators (KPIs), monitor sales trends, and understand customer preferences.

Through visualizing different metrics such as total sales, order volume, product category performance, customer ratings, and regional demand patterns, this dashboard allows the business to identify areas requiring improvement. It highlights products or categories with declining performance, tracks customer satisfaction levels through review analysis, and monitors delivery delays or order return rates. By identifying these operational and customer experience challenges, the company can make informed decisions to optimize marketing strategies, improve logistics, enhance customer service, and ultimately increase overall profitability.
